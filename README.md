## Project Metrics
- **Portfolio Database:** 20 distinct technology stacks indexed and categorized for precise similarity matching.
- **AI Model:** Powered by Groq's `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` for high-speed, accurate job extraction and email generation.
- **Vector Database:** Utilizes ChromaDB for local, persistent vector storage, enabling fast semantic searches on portfolios.
- **Codebase Size:** Lean and maintainable core application built with under 150 lines of Python code (`app.py`, `chains.py`, `portfolio.py`, `utils.py`).


## 📖 Overview

The Cold Email Generator streamlines the business development process. Instead of sending generic templates, this tool:

- Scrapes the job description from a provided URL.
- Analyzes the requirements using an LLM.
- Matches those requirements with the most relevant case studies from your vector database (`my_portfolio.csv`).
- Generates a tailored email that positions your services as the perfect solution.

## ✨ Key Features

- **⚡ Ultra-Fast Generation**: Powered by Groq's LPU inference engine for near-instant email generation.
- **🧠 Context-Aware**: Extracts specific skills and keywords from job descriptions to ensure relevance.
- **📂 Portfolio Integration**: Dynamically pulls the most relevant projects from your portfolio to back up your claims.
- **🕸️ Web Scraping**: Automatically fetches content from career pages using LangChain loaders.
- **🎨 Clean UI**: Built with Streamlit for an easy-to-use interactive interface.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **LLM Engine**: Groq (using Llama 3)
